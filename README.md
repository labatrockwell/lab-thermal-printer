lab-thermal-printer
===================

some arduino and processing sketches for printing using the sparkfun thermal printer

Use the thermal printer library at https://github.com/labatrockwell/Adafruit-Thermal-Printer-Library (until Adafruit accepts the pull request)

This repo contains an array of tests for using the thermal printer to print dynamically-generated images, images streamed via Serial, and data from spacebrew (tethered to a computer)

spacebrew_printer_p is a processing sketch that connects to spacebrew_printer_a running on the arduino and acts as a bridge between spacebrew and the arduino.
