key_to_byte.pd is a puredata patch that turns keypresses into bytes that are sent via Serial. this was used to turn the typing keyboard into a sortof musical keyboard. This arduino sketch is mostly just various tests to experiment with which variables we can play with to give a satisfactory range of sounds.

'A' on the keyboard maps to the theoretically lowest sound, 'a' is much higher than that, and '~' is the highest.
